# Marshall Matters
#### A complete web application to study subconscious biases in business decision making
See the experiment here: https://marshallmatters.netlify.com/

## Overview
Do people really make business decisions based on what they say they do?

This experiment puts that to the test by simulating a hiring scenario where the user (experimentee) is the hiring manager.
1. First the user indicates which candidate traits they believe are relevant to job success.
2. Next the user is given a distraction exercise.
3. Then the user gets to see information about the hypothetical job candidates. The application secretly monitors how long the user looks at different information about the candidates.
4. Lastly the user chooses a candidate for the job.
