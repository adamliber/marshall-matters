      <h1>Study 3</h1>
        <p>
          In Study 3 we would like to have you try your hand at evaluating two job candidates for an entry level
          position in customer support. You will not work with this person,
          you are just involved in the decision of who to bring in for an interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Move the mouse over each of the buttons to see information about each job candidate on the criterion denoted by the button.
          You may view the information on as many or as few of the criteria that you wish, and can spend as long or
          as short reading the information that you mouse over.
          Press the area at the bottom of the page when you are ready to see information about the next candidate.
