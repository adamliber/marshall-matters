      <h1>Study 2</h1>
      <p>
        In this next study you will answer questions about a set of behaviors and attitudes that may have consequences
        for the type of management style that you adopt.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each statement, click the button in the column that best describes you.
        Please answer questions as you actually are (rather than how you think you should be),
        and don't worry if some questions seem to score "in the wrong direction."
